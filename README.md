Bojangles Density by Population in North Carolina
=====

---
Data
==
This is a map that shows the user which counties in North Carolina have the densest amount of bojanglers per county population. The data itself came from a couple of different sources, including the [US Census Bureau for the population information](http://www.census.gov/), [an open-source geoJSON of North Carolina counties](https://data-ncdenr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nc-counties), and [the bojangles website which shows each bojangles in North Carolina](https://locations.bojangles.com/nc.html).

Process and Design
==
The data was compiled into an excel sheet and then transfered into the properties section of the geoJSON file. I chose a colored choropleth map to represent the density of each county, and the county will highlight if the mouse is hovered over it. It will also display specific county information when the mouse is hovered over a county. I wanted the design of the web map to be straight-foward and effective at displaying appropriate information. I kept an orange/red theme throughout the design to have Bojangles' themed colors.
